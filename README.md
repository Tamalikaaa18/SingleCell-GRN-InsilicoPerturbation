## Overview

This repository contains the code and data used for my master's dissertation project titled **"Construction of Gene Regulatory Networks and In-silico perturbation analysis using Single-Cell RNA-seq data of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells"**. The project focuses on analyzing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and performing in silico knockout simulations to study the effects on cellular differentiation and function.

## Key Features

- **Gene Regulatory Network Analysis**: Identification and analysis of cell-type specific GRNs in single-cell RNA sequencing data from PBMCs.
- **In Silico Knockout Simulations**: Simulation of gene knockouts, specifically targeting the EP300 gene, to study its impact on cellular pathways and development of Megakaryocytes.
- **CellOracle Tool**: Utilization of the CellOracle tool for GRN inference and knockout simulation.
